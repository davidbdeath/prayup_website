			<h2>Thank You</h2>
			<p>
				Thank you for your interest in supporting <em>Pray Up</em>. Joseph,
				the creator of <em>Pray Up</em>, created this page to raise support
				for this vision. Joseph has a schedule laid out on the events page that shows the time he commits to
				pray at churches, and he has to drive to and from locations.
				<em>Pray Up</em> is currently enrolled in Elevate ventures, helping
				Joseph prepare for the Nexus Pitch Competition in Indianapolis, Indiana. Joseph will be presenting this
				app idea strategically to raise capital for the <em>Pray Up</em> App
				development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below are Bi-weekly commitments to send Joseph a gift of 5, 10, 20, or 50 dollars every two weeks so he
				can continue doing Pray Up full-time. For each gift, you will get special merchandise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Joseph and his partner David also have created a business called “Creaidiv”. They both give their
				clients expert-level work for videography and website development, design, and maintenance; this is
				another way you can help them stay full-time and committed to this ministry. For more information, email
				Joseph@creaidiv.com (The above video for <em>Pray Up</em> is an
				example of Joseph’s work, and this site was designed by David, the director of technology for
				<em>Pray Up</em>.
